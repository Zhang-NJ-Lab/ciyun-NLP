Lei Zhang is a full-time professor at the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST). He obtained his PhD degree in Natural Science (Physics) from Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. Prior to this, he received his MSc in Composite Materials from Imperial College London, and His BEng degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Before joining NUIST, he is a post-doc at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 

His research interests include materials informatics, photovoltaic materials, energy materials, optoelectronic materials and computational materials science. Recently, he is focusing on the development and application of natural language processing (NLP) and other data-driven methods combined with first-principles calculations to predict and understand photovoltaic materials and beyond.

He has published >100 scientific papers in SCI journals such as Nano Energy and Advanced Functional Materials. He has refereed hundreds of manuscripts for journals including Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), Matter, ACS Nano, NPJ Computational Materials, Journal of Chemical Information and Modelling, Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, Journal of Physical Chemistry C, ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces, Journal of Materials Chemistry A, Journal of Materials Chemistry C, Nano Research, Journal of Power Sources, Advanced Electronic Materials, Journal of Power Sources, Nanoscale, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, Solar Engergy Materials and Solar Cells, Cell Reports Physical Science, etc.
